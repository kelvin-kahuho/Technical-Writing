# Introduction to Programming

Have you watched the movie 'Terminator'? Does programming give you the power to create robots that at some point might be self aware and start a war? This blog is for programming newbies or anyone who enjoys reading tech stuff.

In simple words, programming is telling the computer what to do. Programming is derived from the word program, which are a set of instructions that work together to complete a task. A simple "Hello World" program is a program! How amazing is that. Programming is the backbone of the digital age we live in, from simple calculators to complex artificial intelligence- it enables us to create remarkable things.

# Why Learn Programming

Learning programming equips you with the skillset to survive in the digital world. You can learn to create websites, web and mobile applications, AI systems, embedded systems, and many more. The art gives you limitless options- the limit is set in your imagination. For instance, any electronic device has some program(s) running. But, it's not just about creating but also having the necessary skills to improve, fix or modify existing systems that have been created. This doesn't come easy, the learning curve to be a programmer is steap, you need consistency and dedication. Programming opens up endless career opportunities, as almost every industry requires tech-savvy professionals.

# Tools used in Programming

Just like any other activity, there are tools used in programming to make your life as a programmer easier. The better you understand how to use these tools the better you will be as a programmer. First, you need a laptop. I won't go deeper into the specs but the higher the processing power is preferred. Secondly, you need an IDE(Intergrated Development Environment)- This is a software program that allows you to create software programs more efficiently. Since there are many IDEs out there, your choice depends on what you intend to accomplish, but VS Code is highly recommended by most developers. Lastly, you need to learn a programming language. A programming language is a language you can use to communicate with the computer. Optional, you might need internet access for research purposes.

# Programming Languages

Many programming languages have been developed for different purposes. Newbies get mixed up trying to understand different languages that might not be related in the long run. Different programming languages have different purposes, syntax, semantics, and grammer, but they all do the same thing, telling a computer what to do. As a beginner, one should focus on learning a system level programming language like C since it teaches you the fundamentals of computer programming, furthermore, most programming languages are developed from C. But, I wouldn't advice you to stick with it, learn a high-level language like Python and Java. High level programming languages make programming easier- but not that easy!

# Popular Programming Languages

1. Python

Python is a multipurpose high level programming language. Multipurpose, meaning you can use it to build a wide range of systems, for example, you can build web and mobile applications, perform data anlysis, build machine learning models, create chatbots... the list is endless. With its simplicity and versatility, it's perfect for beginners.

2. JavaScript

Powering dynamic web pages, this is another language worth exploring. JavaScript brings interactivity to web-pages. Those cool animations you see on the web, JavaScript was probably used. But it's not only limited to the web, the introduction of Node.js showed promising future in JavaScript, it allows you to build web and mobile applications. You can also do machine learning using JS.

3. Java 

Java is known for its reliability and platform independence. "Write once, run everywhere" is the slogan for Java developers. Most electronic devices have Java installed during manufacturing, that means you can run your Java code on almost all machines. Personally I believe the language is easy and beginner friendly.

4. C++

This language focuses on system level programming. You can build an Operating Sytem with it!


# Getting Started: Setting up the Environment

Download an IDE of your choice, but I'd recommend VS Code or Intellij Idea for Java Developers. Visit the official website of the language you want to use and follow the installation instructions and install the language on your machine.

# Basic Concepts

Programming is built on essential concepts. Variables hold data, and data types define the kind of information stored. Operators perform actions on variables, and control flow statements help you make decisions and repeat tasks.

# Understanding functions

Functions are the building blocks of programming. They allow you to break down complex tasks into manageable pieces and reuse code efficiently. Think of them as mini-programs within your main program.

# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around "objects" that encapsulate data and behavior. Objects are like duplicating real world object into the digital world. It promotes code reusability and organization, making it easier to manage larger projects.

# Input and Output

Interacting with users and displaying results is crucial in programming. You'll learn how to receive input from users and present information through the console or graphical interfaces.

# Resources for Learning Programming

As a tech enthusiast or programming newbie, you're in luck! Countless online tutorials, interactive coding platforms like Codecademy and freeCodeCamp, and beginner-friendly books await you on your learning journey.

# Real-World Applications

Programming's real power comes to life through its applications. Websites, mobile apps, games, and automation tools are just a few examples. You'll be amazed at how programming touches every aspect of modern life.


In conclusion, embarking on a programming journey may feel daunting, but remember that every programmer starts as a beginner. Embrace the learning process, practice consistently, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Programming is a vast world of possibilities, and your determination will lead you to exciting destinations. Stay curious and explore different programming languages and projects. Engage with coding communities, ask questions, and learn from experienced programmers. The journey may have challenges, but the rewards of mastering programming are boundless.
